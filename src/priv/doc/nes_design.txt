User Scenario
=============
- one shader output a 2D texture that is used as input of another 3D texture.
- one shader output a 2D texture that is used by many-many of other shaders.
- shader get vertex data from universal vertex buffer stored in main memory.
- 2 draws use same shader. the 1st draw render to texture; the second draw 
  render to back buffer.
- Adjust global quality parameter (like texture filtering), to increase overall
  rendering quality.
- user creates too many render targets that can't fit into hardware's local
  memory (like EDRAM)
  - may be resolved by lazy creation
  - check CPU "register renaming" and "buffer renaming" in graphics driver for
    more ideas.
