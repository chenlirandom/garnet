User Scenario
=============
- one shader output a 2D texture that is used as input of another shader that 
  requires 3D texture.
- one shader output a cube texture that is used by other shaders as 6 
  independent 2D textures.
- one shader output a 2D texture that is used by many-many of other shaders.
- shader get data from general CPU data buffer.
  - read vertices from fat vertex buffer
  - read DXT texture from uncompressed texture
  - read cubemap from 6 2D textures
- 2 draws use same shader. the 1st draw render to texture; the second draw 
  render to back buffer.
- Adjust global quality parameter (like texture filtering), to increase overall
  rendering quality.
- user creates too many render targets that can't fit into hardware's local
  memory (like EDRAM)
  - may be resolved by lazy creation
  - check CPU "register renaming" and "buffer renaming" in graphics driver for
    more ideas.
