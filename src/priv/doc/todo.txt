TODO
====

- implement POSIX version of GN::path:glob()
- UT for path functions: resolve, glob
- implement GNogl using glut.
- Refine GFX:
  - move window property save/restore code to a centrol place,
    such as in changeDevice().
- Looks like OGL extension string has '\0' in it:
  - only happens on msra-chenli-x64
- Startup of GFXOGL module sometimes very slow:
  - pin down to the 1st DescribePixelFormat() in sChoosePixelFormat() in oglWinDisp.cpp
- Run UT for both GFXD3D and GFXOGL will throw exception.
  - happens on home-pc, msra-chenli and msra-chenli-x64 (all are NVidia cards)

DONE
====
- Fix link problem of GFX module in static build.
- Refine GFX:
