OPENNING
========

- Startup of GFXOGL module sometimes very slow:
  - pin down to the 1st call to opengl function in oglWinDisp.cpp
  - It seems caused by remote symbol loading

- Render target image is up-side-down in OGL, comparing with D3D.
  - See GNsampleRenderToTexture for an example.

- GNsampleRenderToTexture:
  - black screen on cygwin.

- When using non-power-of-two texture, ATI x1000 card runs very very slow. Check it!

- Quad renderer is slow on HP notebook with intel graphics chip.

CLOSED
======

- ATI depth texture doesn't work when backbuffer size is smaller then texture size (only happens when using debug DX runtime. So seems a DX bug)
  - FIXED (2006.5.18): upgrade ATI driver to 6.4
