Design of unified rendering API


Rule #1: there's no way to achieve ultimate unification and performance
simuteneously,

Rule #2: Generally, unification has priority.


Issues
======

* How to define array texture? since some API does not support that.
  - just define it, return failure for texture creation if API does not support it.

* Is script (renderman?) driven interface the future?
  - I need to learn renderman first before I can answer this question
