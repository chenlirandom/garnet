- p0
  - unit test: DynaArray<???,uint8>
  - New Engine module entity class
    - RTTI
    - unique entity ID
    - optional entity name (might not be unique)
    - unify entity and component interface
    - weak reference
    - loop through all entities
    - loop through entities of specific type
    - loop through entities that are referenced by another entity

- p1
  - Shader resource library: DLL or static library that defines common
    shaders.
  - Compositable shader component:
    - What about existing shader authoring tool?
      - there's no tools that is simply good enough.
        - RenderMonkey has dead for a long time.
        - FxCompose is too FX centric. It does not support GLSL.
    - It is a standalone offline toolset that generates EffectDescriptor or XML file.
    - It is not meant for runtime use.
    - features
      - optional shader parameter
    - example:
      - diffuse light shader:
        - input: position, normal, color(optional)
        - output: color
      - skinning shader:
        - input: position, normal(optional), binormal(optional), skinning(bones+weights)
        - output: position, normal(optional), binormal(optional)
      - texturing:
        - input texcoord, color(optional)
        - output: color
      - final shader = diffuse shader + skinning shader + texturing shader.
    - See if there's existing (open source) code

  - A boost style smart pointer template that do not require inheritence form
    GN::RefCounter.

- p2
  - Code tree reorg
    - Flatten code tree
    - Try Re-enable "non-static" build

  - replace FBX test app with something else (not owned by Autodesk).
  - refine PCH builder to generate PCH out of "pch.h" directly, instead of from "pch.cpp".
    so that the PCH builder works the same way in gcc and vstudio.
  - Refine uniform loading from XML
  - A half-edge mesh for complex mesh algorithm
  - PCXS2 GPU plugin:
    - move operations to GPU as much as possible
    - model beautifier
      - add bump map and tessellation to PS2 model if possible.
      - implement a CPU based prototype first.
  - DDS viewer plugin
  	- don't write full viewer from scratch.
  	- just provide a plugin for existing picture viewers like acdsee or something.
  - sigslot class:
    - allow any type of functor
    - check behavior of redundant slot functors.
  - refine Delegate performance: avoid virtual functions
  - memory-mapped IO.

  - cross-platform window util functions:
    - set window title
    - change window size
    - ...
    - use wxWidgets?
  - runtime call-stack dump
  - in game GUI:
  - make sure OGL resource creation/deletion do not affect renderer states
    - depends on OGL renderer state dumper

  - network layer
  - multi-window rendering
  - image format conversion
  - a ray tracer (for self-learning purpose)

RESOLVE ISSUES
==============

- FontFace unit should be integer or float?
  - RESOLVED: float.
  - Keep it float in case for 3D texture rendering.
  - For 2D rendering, the renderer could round the float to integer.

- Capital function name or not?
  - RESOLVED: No. Function/Method name starts with lower case character.
  - pros:
    - function/method name is never same as type name: Gpu & gpu()
    - won't conflict with Windows API macro like CreateFile.
  - cons: more renaming works when porting other codes into garnet library.

- Could mesh be a first class parameter of GPU, like texture?
  - RESOLVED: No, since that would make resource aliasing very hard, if not impossible.

- Unified interface for different APIs is too difficult, and maybe pointless.
  How about a higher level abstraction: material/effect system?
  - RESOLVED: we need both
    - They stay at different levels and serve for different purposes.
      - Unified API is easy for prototyping, and simplify tasks like clearing
        screen, presenting, switching display mode, handling device lost.
      - Material/effect system is required to build complex rendering framework.
        It could be built upon unified API, or not.

- Custom string class or std::string?
  - RESOLVED: custom string class.
  - WHY?
    - std::string can't accept NULL pointer as valid input.
    - std::char_trait<wchar_t> is not well supported on cygwin.

- TinyXml, RapidXml or Expat?
  - RESOLVED: expat.
  	- TinyXml is too slow.
    - RapidXml does not support encoding right. It always read text as single
      byte char*, which means it might confuse the second byte of a multi-byte
      character with a ascii character.
    - Custom DOM wrapper fits our requirement better, and is pretty easy to implement.

- What file format should we support:
  - RESOLVED: FBX, COLLADA and garnet native format.
    - FBX
      - binary format get loaded fast.
      - free SDK.
      - but, no xbox support
    - COLLADA:
      - need to get a good loader for that.
      - format is open, which mean it could be supported on all platforms.
      - but, ascii format get loaded slowly.
    - ASE
      - does not support skeleton animation. It can't be imported back to 3ds max.
    - ma (maya ascii):
      - need to write my own loader.
    - assimp:
      - promising candidate. Investe more.

- Do we need to separate shading language enum and shader model enum?
  - RESOLVED: Yes.
    - One shading language, like Cg, could be compiled into multiple shader models; and vice versa.
    - Shader model enum is used to determine the GPU hardware caps.
    - Shading language enum is used to choose the shader compiler.

OPEN ISSUES
===========

- Embbed buffer for short string?

- Possible engine module features:
  - build visual component by combining several existing visual components.
  - entity embeded in another entity.

DROPPED TASKS
=============
- runtime configuable profilers, like loggers
  - WHY: profiler has to be light-weight and fast. Logger style configuration
         is too heavy.
