BUGS
====

- GFX:
  - GetDeviceCaps(...) in basicDispMgr.cpp always returns information of the 
    monitor where the render window was orginally created in.
  - After fullscreen application is minimized, seems that WaitOnMessage() has
    no effects.

TODO
====

- cross-platform window util functions:
  - set window title
  - change window size
  - ...
- GN_TRACE( level, msg, .... )
- runtime call-stack dump
- hash map/table
- import input module
- implement POSIX version of GN::path:glob()
- UT for path functions: resolve, glob
- implement GNogl using glut.
- Startup of GFXOGL module sometimes very slow:
  - pin down to the 1st DescribePixelFormat() in sChoosePixelFormat() in oglWinDisp.cpp
  - It seems caused by remote symbol loading

DONE
====
- Fix link problem of GFX module in static build.
- Refine GFX:
  - Window property save/restore
  - Refine ntWindow class:
    - support external window
    - getClientSize();
  - remove platform specific code from display manager.
  - UT for GFX module: using external render window
- Run UT for both GFXD3D and GFXOGL will throw exception.
  - FIXED: should use different render window class for each instance of NTRenderWindow.
